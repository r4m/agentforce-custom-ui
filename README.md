### **Intro**

#### Use Case

This project seamlessly integrates AI-powered case management with picture upload, real-time document visualization, and chunk highlighting for cited knowledge in Agentforce responses. It leverages Salesforce Knowledge Base (KB), Heroku Events, and WebSockets to enhance chatbot interactivity and automate case resolution.

#### Customer Pain Points Addressed

‚ö†Ô∏è Problem 1: Users don‚Äôt trust AI-generated answers

üîª Users need to **verify the source of AI responses** before making business decisions.  
‚úÖ **Solution:** The web app **renders KB documents dynamically, highlighting the exact passage** used by the AI.

‚ö†Ô∏è Problem 2: Case creation is slow and manual

üîª Users **must manually submit cases via email or phone**, which delays resolution.  
‚úÖ **Solution:** Agentforce **automatically creates the Case and requests additional details** dynamically.

‚ö†Ô∏è Problem 3: Users must manually attach files to cases

üîª Support teams often require **images/videos to verify product issues**, but **uploading and linking files is a manual process**.  
‚úÖ **Solution:** The chatbot **guides the user to upload an image**, which is **automatically attached to the Case** in Salesforce.
